							Howl's Moving Castle
						</h1>
						<p>
							Howl's Moving Castle is a 2004 Japanese animated fantasy film scripted and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. 
							The film is based on the novel of the same name by British writer Diana Wynne Jones. 
							The film was produced by Toshio Suzuki, animated by Studio Ghibli and distributed by Toho. 
							Mamoru Hosoda, director of one episode and two movies from the Digimon series, was originally selected to direct but abruptly left the project, leaving the then-retired Miyazaki to take up the director's role.

							The film is one of only three (out of a current 18) Studio Ghibli films which were not released in July. 
							It went on to gross $190 million in Japan and $235 million worldwide, making it one of the most financially successful Japanese films in history. 
							The film was later dubbed into English by Pixar's Peter Docter and distributed in North America by Walt Disney Pictures. 
							It received a limited release in the United States and Canada beginning June 10, 2005 and was released nationwide in Australia on September 22 and in the United Kingdom the following September.
