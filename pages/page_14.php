							Princess Mononoke
						</h1>
						<p>
							Princess Mononoke is a 1997 anime epic action historical fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. 
							It was animated by Studio Ghibli and produced by Toshio Suzuki. 
							The film stars the voices of Yoji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yuko Tanaka, Kaoru Kobayashi, Masahiko Nishimura, Akihiro Miwa, Mitsuko Mori and Hisaya Morishige.
							Princess Mononoke is set in the late Muromachi period (approximately 1336 to 1573) of Japan with fantasy elements.

							The story follows the young Emishi warrior Ashitaka's involvement in a struggle between forest gods and the humans who consume its resources. 
							The term "Mononoke"  is not a name, but a Japanese word for a spirit or monster.
							Princess Mononoke was released in Japan on July 12, 1997, and in the United States on October 29, 1999. 
							It was a critical and commercial success, becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan of 1997, and the highest-grossing there of all time until Titanic was released later that year. 
							It was translated and distributed in North America by Miramax Films, and despite a poor box office performance there, it sold well on DVD and video, bringing Ghibli attention in the United States for the first time.
