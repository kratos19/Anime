							In 1988, Streamline Pictures produced an exclusive dub for use on transpacific flights by Japan Airlines. 
							Troma Films, under their 50th St. Films banner, distributed the dub of the film co-produced by Jerry Beck. 
							It was released on VHS and DVD by Fox Video. Troma's and Fox's rights to this version expired in 2004. 
							The film was re-released by Walt Disney Pictures on March 7, 2006 and by Madman on March 15, 2006. It features a new dub cast. 
							This DVD release is the first version of the film in the United States to include both Japanese and English language tracks, as Fox did not have the rights to the Japanese audio track for their version.
